A Python program to demonstrate time dilation and Special Relativity.

## Overview
This program shows how much time is dilated at different speeds, with respect to the speed of light, in a fun way. It assumes a unique scenario, where you have to spend time with your Girlfriend (the option for boyfriend is not yet added, I'm not homophobic) but the time on earth is not enough, so you go to a trip through space with her, at different fractions of speed of light, and the program displays how much time is spent on earth for your one hour in space.<br/>

It uses the Lorent'z factor to calculate the dilation:<br/>
$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$

## Chandrayaan-3
The definitive version of the program, modern UI, sleek looks and still the same old dilation.

## Instructions
- NO need to install any libraries!!
- Just run:
```bash
python chandrayaan3.py
```

- Enter your speed relative to speed of light.
- You'll know how much time you have with your gf.

I would like to thank Albert Einstein, you might have heard of him, German Physicist, cool guy<br/>
I would also like to thank Hendrik Lorentz, a Dutch Physicist for this beautiful formula<br/>
I would also like to thank another cool person, who is the reason I made this, whom I can't name, cause reasons.
