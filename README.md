A Python program to demonstrate time dilation and Special Relativity.

## Overview
This program shows how much time is dilated at different speeds, with respect to the speed of light, in a fun way. It assumes a unique scenario, where you have to spend time with your Girlfriend (the option for boyfriend is not yet added, I'm not homophobic) but the time on earth is not enough, so you go to a trip through space with her, at different fractions of speed of light, and the program displays how much time is spent on earth for your one hour in space.<br/>

It uses the Lorent'z factor to calculate the dilation:<br/>
$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$

It's a kind of work in progress right now, the entire program is sorted, I just have to improve the GUI.
